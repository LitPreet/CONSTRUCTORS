Parameterized Constructors:
 It is possible to pass arguments to constructors. Typically, these arguments help initialize an object when it is created.
 To create a parameterized constructor, simply add parameters to it the way you would to any other function.
 When you define the constructorâ€™s body, use the parameters to initialize the object
